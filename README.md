#UVA Computer Engineering / Civil Engineering Capstone - Fall 2014

This project focuses on recreating a LabVIEW state chart in order to show that an approach for parsing EPS files into instructions for a "robot" is plausible.

Here, Java turtles represent robots with perfect encoders, and can thus prove the application of a state chart approach for directing a robot to draw construction floor plans (a Civil engineering application). 

Screenshots of the LabVIEW code can be found in the screenshots folder. The Java code was written to mirror the state chart, so all data is passed on Maps (LabVIEW bundles) and methods represent VIs and sub VIs.

This capstone was done under the direction of Professors Mircea Stan (CPE) and Brian Smith (CE).
